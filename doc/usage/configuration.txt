This file explains post compilation steps. It assumes that "nss-exo"
is compiled and that it exists in the system libraries directory (/lib).


 1. Create handler/listener
----------------------------

"nss-exo" uses an external delegated handler/listener to provide authentication services.

Thus, the first thing that it is needed is at least one such handler.

One example, implemented in PHP, is provided, as well as its SQLite backend database, and some example data.

The expected location for the default handler is "/etc/nss/exo/handler".
The expected location for the PHP handler is "/etc/nss/exo/handler.php".
The expected location for the SQLite database is "/etc/system.db".

The handler should output an XML formatted string when called.
User-friendly example data files "user.xml" and "group.xml" are provided in the "Configuration/" folder.
The format is fixed, except for the equivalent shadowed user section:
	In "user.xml", the section "/xml/user/authentication/password/crypted" should be present (only) when "shadow" is requested as the argument.
	The section can be provided when the argument is not "shadow", as it is not needed, being ignored.
Note that the spacing is important in the output: any new line is included in the interpretation, so try to keep those absent.

The accepted calling arguments are:
	Get user information:
		(e.g.: getent passwd <user name>)
			./handler (user|password|passwd) get (id|name) <value for the ID or the name>
	Get shadowed user information:
		(e.g.: getent shadow <user name>)
			./handler shadow get name <value for the name (user name)>
	Get group information:
		(e.g.: getent group <group name>)
			./handler group get (id|name) <value for the ID or the name>
	Get all member groups for the specified user name:
			./handler groups get name <value for the name>

	Please note that these arguments can change in incompatible ways in the future!


 2. Configure nsswitch.conf
----------------------------

The second step is to tell glibc that we use this lib. Open /etc/nsswitch.conf
and add "exo" on the lines which you want to use the software for.
The currently supported Name Service Switch services are passwd, group, and shadow.
You should obtain something like this:

...
passwd:		... exo ...
group:		... exo ...
shadow:		... exo ...
...

 3. Test
---------

Insert some additional records in the SQLite DB tables (optional), open a new shell (nsswitch.conf is
only read when a new application is launched) and try:

id <an user name in the db>
getent passwd <an user name in the db>
getent group <a group name in the db>
getent shadow <an user name in the db>

 4. Limitations
----------------

At least a few!
